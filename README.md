# Fizz Buzz Implementation in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Fizz Buzz problem in C++.

## What is Fizz Buzz?

Fizz Buzz is a common programming task used in software developer job interviews. The program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

## Features

- Implements the Fizz Buzz logic for numbers 1 to 100
- Uses C++ and standard input/output
